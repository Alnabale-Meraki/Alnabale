Important Rules
If you are stuck on the same question for more than 10 minutes during the lecture,  ask us immediately (always read the entire question then ask us).
If you are stuck on the same question for more than 3 times during the lecture time, you should skip it and go for the next one (and you come back to it after going through all the questions).
If you are stuck on the same question for more than 30 minutes after you skip it, you should ask us.
You can always attend other class lectures (Alpha, Beta, Charlie) but you should be a watcher only with a little bit of questions.
You are not allowed to use google or search for an answer except if there is a hint in the practice questions (tell you to search or read about something).
Cheating is not allowed, you are cheating if you copy more than 1 line from the internet and you can't explain it or do like it.
Don't turn off Zoom while you are on a break (just disable the microphone and the camera) and when you come back click on Yes so we know that you returned.
You need to work on yourself a lot, you should study 25-45 hours per week (to review material, solve material questions, do homeworks, and make projects).

Extra Materials && Resources (No need till now)
Deploying/Hosting Node.js app on Heroku with MySQL database
Be sure to have a main rute (something like this):
mainRouter.get('/test', (req, res) => {  res.json('Hello World Server); });

Download Heroku cli
Create Heroku account and Verify your account (by your email)
Log in to Heroku in Command Line: heroku login
Create a Heroku app => heroku create [app-name]   (will be the url)
To rename the app name: heroku apps:rename --app [old-app-name] [new-app-name]
For this step you need to bring your backend code to the root of the project (so you will have all the code for the backend and for the frontend it will be in a file called client)
Deploy the app to Heroku => git push heroku master 
Configure MySQL Database for Node.js on Heroku app: 
Setup ClearDB: (you need to add credit card for your account to verify it so you can add this feature for free)
heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite
Configure MySQL connection:  (you need to read how to get the link)
heroku config | grep CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL_HERE (don't forget to copy this link)
If you got an error about ‘grep’ only
heroku config | findstr CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL
Set the database => heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=’DB URL’
Example: mysql://bd65d6e778xxff:561exxfa@us-cdbr-east-02.cleardb.com /heroku_985485f75f52cbb?reconnect=true
Username: bd65d6e778xxff
Password: 561exxfa
Host: us-cdbr-east-02.cleardb.com
Database Name: heroku_985485f75f52cbb
Config Node.js to connect ClearDB MySQL on Heroku:
Get the username, password, host, database and use them to configure db in node on heroku (take all the env variables and add them to heroku), go to your heroku project => settings => Config Vars => and add them all

Create MySQL tables on ClearDB:
mysql --host=HOSTNAME_HERE --user=USERNAME_HERE --password=PASSWORD_HERE --reconnect DATABASE_NAME_HERE
Example: mysql --host=us-cdbr-east-02.cleardb.com --user=bd65d6e778xxff --password=561exxfa --reconnect heroku_985485f75f52cbb
Now create your database tables like MySQL
Test the Heroku app on local => heroku local (test localhost:5000)
Test the Heroku app on Heroku => heroku run node server.js
Test your project with a postman.

Now let's connect React:
Rename front-end folder to client
Add these two lines to the server:
const path = require('path'); 
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build')));
Add this line to the server package.json in the scripts:
"heroku-postbuild": "cd client && npm install --only=dev && npm install && npm run build"
Add this line to the client package.json:
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
